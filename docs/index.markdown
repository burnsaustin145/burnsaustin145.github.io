## Semantic Networks
My interest in AI began with the concept of semantic networks, and idea I learned from Douglas Hofstadters [GEB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach). Since I have been interested in representing and manipulating knowledge in graph/hypergraph based structures. 

Below is one such abstract structure.
